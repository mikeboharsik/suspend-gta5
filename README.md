# Overview
This is a port of [SuspendGTA5PS](https://github.com/mikeboharsik/SuspendGTA5PS) which is intended to be more user-friendly for non-developers.

# Usage
Download and run one of the built `suspend-gta5.exe` files from the [releases page](https://github.com/mikeboharsik/suspend-gta5/releases). Make sure you allow the app through the firewall if you want to be able to connect via another device, like a phone.

Use a browser to connect to either `http://localhost` or whatever local IP address or hostname your PC is accessible at.
